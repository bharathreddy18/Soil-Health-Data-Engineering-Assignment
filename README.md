# Soil Health Data Intern Assignment
This repository contains my work for the Data Intern Assignment, focused on scraping soil nutrient data from the Soil Health Dashboard.

Completed Work: Task 1 - Data Scraping
Script: get_raw_data.py
Scrapes village-level MacroNutrient and MicroNutrient data from the dashboard.

Navigates through:

Cycles: 2023–24 and 2024–25

States → Districts → Blocks

Handles dynamic content loading using Selenium.

Saves data in a structured format:

data/raw/{cycle}/{state}/{district}/{block}_macro.csv

data/raw/{cycle}/{state}/{district}/{block}_micro.csv

Includes:

Logging

Basic error handling

Progress tracking

Directory Structure

Incomplete Tasks

Due to lack of time, I was only able to complete the data scraping part of the assignment. I did not see the assignment email on time because it went to my spam folder.

As a result, the following parts are incomplete:

Task 2: Data Consolidation & Transformation

Task 3: Data Analysis & Insights

Notes
Although I could not complete all tasks, I focused on making the scraping logic as complete and robust as possible, including error handling and dynamic page interaction. If I had more time, I would have proceeded to clean and analyze the data next.

Thank you for the opportunity, and I hope this demonstrates my approach and effort within the limited time I had.
